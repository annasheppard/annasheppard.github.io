<p>You chose your mother. Possibly because she was always choosing you when it came to every one of her decisions. Possibly in death she would have chosen to have a detective question you, but that is a timeline
  that will never be of this one. Detective Gunn knocked on her door, a small white house in a rather rural area. She answered quite quickly making sure he wiped his feet on the mat, this is something she always did.
  Sam made sure to look through photos and ask about relatives, friends, people you had known currently. Your mother replied that she wasn't fully up to date on your business. Sam, with his back to your mom, rolled 
  his eyes in annoyance. Your mother offered him a glass of water to which he denied. He then queride of your place of business and if I had ever complained about any coworkers. Your mother didn't know. Your mother 
  didn't seem to know a lot, and also appeared to be just confused and upset. She asked Gunn to excuse her for she needed to use the restroom. Gunn sat at the dining room table and looked closely at the pictures your 
  mother had proudly plastered all over her walls. He looked into a picture framed by old wood. Upon the yellow-tinted paper was a moment where you graduated from High School. You didn't look pleased, yet you stood 
  proud.

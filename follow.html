  <p>So you've decided to follow the black truck. You're facing the driver from the outside, it's truly difficult to see this person's facail features. It's not like the movies even though it seems as if this is a film of some sort.
    For lack of a better term, this is real life in which you're looking in on. With careful manuvers and spiratically turning off and on their headlights, it's clear that the driver has made their way home, atleast to a house. They
    exit the truck and you follow them into their house. At this point you gain no entry once the door closes. Anywhere you've wandered in your life you may wander in death, but there is no more adventuring into any place one has not 
    been. With this, you never gained any knowledge of this person through your stalking. But you may peer inside where you see them stand by a kitchen table and remove the coat. It's become clear of who it may be, a tall man with short,
    dark hair whos staggers into a room that does not allow any vision into. You decide to move around the house, or rather, you have to look at the rest of the house because it's what you have to do. You see many buckets that fill the 
    otherwise emptiness of the garage. The garden hose looks freshly used and leeks fresh water into a puddle that now looks as though it might not fully be water. On further inspection, parts of the water seem a little red like the 
    appearance of blood. You contemplate whether it's the blood that used to belong to you. Time passes in which you are subjected to returning back to the sight of your body. Within time, and at night, the figure returns. This time with
    tools. A shovel, a tree saw, and a clear poncho. You can only watch as the figure dismembers your body and barries it in the ground. There are moments in which the figure looks weakened by the bariel but persists on hiding you. After 
    finishing the job, they leave the area. You spend the rest of eternity in this spot, besides the occasional animal, hiker, hunter, weather, errosion, and change of nature, you remain. Within this time, one can only be here, outside of
    this time is what is left to be decided.</p>
  <p>Welcome to the end of your story, feel free to return to the beginning and try a new path<a href=http://annasheppard.com/>here</a></p>

<p>You chose your father because he always knew how to talk about you. Detective Gunn visits his residence and knocks on his door. Your father answers looking as if he hasn't slept in a few days. He steps asside to let Gunn in and they discuss your personal life.
  Your father knows about your current groupings and where you go on Saturday nights. He doesn't recall any serious difficulties in your life except for struggling to keep in contact with your mother. He mentions that you are somewhat short with people but don't
  give everyone a hard time. Everyonce in a while your father gets up to look out the window. The third time doing this, Sam writes down <em>paranoid</em> in his notepad. Detective Gunn decides this is enough questioning of your father but believes he has some intell
  on someone who might be a prime suspect. As Gunn drives back to the station he watches as your father almost instantly leaves his house in his car. Gunn raises an eyebrow and sighs. A weeks passes and Gunn schedules a time to visit your mother.</p>

<body>
<p>So, you've decided to stay alongside your corpse. Here is where you directly stay until four months since your death. In the light of some mornings, you've noticed more and more about your lifeless body.
Scars appear on your arms and legs that are bare, what you never noticed was the lack of clothing you have. Alongside your person lay the essentials: a purse, an empty wallet, a stray eerring with no partner, 
and pen that reads out a company. The company is called <em>Simple Suiters</em> with a heart beside the name. With all the time that passed there is no feeling of loss, you don't feel, remember. A few animals 
have visited your body but do not pay it any mind. A skunk appraoches you and inspects. With the amount of intrugue in your various smells, the skunk also notices you, meaning he notices from where you see from.
You wonder how to communicate, but the skunk hobbles away carrying on in their lifetime. As four months comes to an end, you spot several figures walking through the woods making their way past your body with 
great distance from it. This is because the grass is tall and you never were an abvious fellow. One figure walks close though. As he gets closer you are made aware of his features. This man is old, grey hair 
and beard make up his face. He holds a riffle and walks nonchalantly towards you. He slows down and appears concerned. He stops and says something quitly. Then he steps back and looks around. Confusion fills his 
face as he starts walking swiftly back to the woods. After several long periods of time, a few people come back to the site. Not so long after that, you are removed from the area and placed in a small chamber 
below a hospital. This is where they look deeply into your injuries that lay upon your skin. As an observer, the only information you truly gain from the situation is the severity of head trauma you received. 
All your bones are intact but you're gentitals don't go unharmed. The clothes that onces clung to your body are removed now and you pear down on a grey, decomposing case in which you once roamed around in. You 
can't feel the true dispare you might think you do, but this is something you choose to experience.

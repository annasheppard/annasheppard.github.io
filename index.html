  <h4>❤︎made for my mother and father❤︎</h4>
  <div>
  <p>So why made a website for your poetry, well, I'm glad you asked. I've been an avid writer since the day I could ... write. But storytelling has always been
    the most important thing for me to do. If something as unreal as a fictional story could drive someone to tears from either sarrow or laughter I want all in 
    because that excites me. So below are going to be all my works. From chaos to subtlety, I'll always have something to write because the amount of word 
    combonations is infinate.</p>

  <h4>Joy Ride</h4>
    <p>The car is where I ponder
</p>
    <p>To the window, my eyes wander</p>
    <p>I curl my legs up on the chair</p>
    <p>As we carry on to anywhere</p>
    <p>As trees loose form in speed</p>
    <p>I feel the need to pee</p>
    <p>My bladder cannot wait</p>
    <p><But mother says we're already late/p>
    <p>I envy a younger me</p>
    <p>One who didn't suffer the need</p>
    <p>To release the muscles from the tension</p>

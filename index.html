    <h1>GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. 
        <br/> As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
        <br/>Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant;
        <br/>they too have their story.
        <br/><br/></h1>

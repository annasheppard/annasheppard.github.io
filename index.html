  <h4>Hello</h4>
  <h4>Welcome to the story</h4>
  <h2>The Willows After Dark</h2>
  <p>It's cold, you feel sctachy grass below you, you open your eyes to reveal bright specks across your vision. It's the sky, and your surroundings are dim. 
    Trees fill the outskirts of where you lay, a dark feild. You check your arms that are pale and itchy. You reach your right hadn to your left shoulder and 
    scratch but cannot feel that it has moved. Adjusting your arm you watch as it still lies dead, on the ground. Sitting up now, you peer down at your lifeless 
    body, black rings around your once lively eyes, veins seeping through the skin because blood doesn't travel through them anymore. This all confuses you, but 
    you insist of configuring your past. Standing now, you look down to see nothing takes up the space where you see from. This is because you're dead, and it 
    all becomes quite obvious at this moment. Before stepping forward with your nothiness of legs, you spy a figure in the distance. The only moving black object 
    for miles looks as though they are walking towards you, but this is difficult to tell for they are directly away from where your body lays. Thinking of where 
    it is you would like to go, suddenly you're right by this walker. It's someone in a black cloak moving fast towards the woods. He, or she, is 2 feet away but
    quickly gaining distance from you. With haste, you imagine walking towards them, and therfore you do. You've got the hang of it, <em>if I think, therefore I am.</em> 
    you imagine. This is a method that is familiar since you believe you have practiced this before. Possibly before birth this was where you lurked in time, but
    it is not certain. Following the figure, you attempt to know of their identity but it is a failure. The shadows are still as deceiving as they once where in 
    life. The figure comes upon a path and halts their movement. At that moment they search in their pockets for something. A light spreads in front of them from 
    their phone and they continue. You follow not sure of the necessity of knowing where the figure is going. But, since death, all decision are made of universal 
    code, what must happen is of the decision the universe makes. You may not turn left at this moment and possibly wander into the future alone. The likeness of
    the living and the dead is not having the free will to decide, but rather be present for the experience. In the afterlife, you are to know of this creation and
    learn of what you didn't know in life. Here, you are safe from physical harm but are forever in the existance of time. Even though one would often like to think
    of this as some sort of hell, it is unlike life in the fact that experiencing doesn't involve judgement. You see, the dead can not feel, therefore they can only
    experience through sight, smell, and hearing. Returning the topic back to your current space, your suspect has arrived to a car that seemed to appear out of 
    nowhere. The character quickly enters the vehicle and starts the engine. With sudden force, you stop following and are subjected to watching a mystery unfold. 
    Now, here is the fun part of death, deciding. The universe wouldn't be so much of an enigma if it didn't spice things up a bit, so it begs the question:</p>

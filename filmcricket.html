  <p><em>Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse</em></p>
  <p>Sprider-man: Into the Spider-verse is Sci-Fi, Fantasy Spider-man return we all expected. It might not be the extreme we wanted but it fits into the cookie cutter world of Marvel. 
    As I am not a large Marvel fan I can say I enjoyed the unfamilarity it sort of had. Though it doesn't seem to be so exclusive to fans, it holds some hidden easter eggs for truw viewers.
    Such as the scene in which the main character mocks to infamous Spider-Man 3 scene where Peter Parker strolls down the NYC streets. This possible block-buster holds a lot of good
    storytelling I'm sure the entire family can enjoy, even the "film snobs".
